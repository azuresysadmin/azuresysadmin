-  Iâ€™m currently getting a deeper knowledge in automation; such as Terraform/Terragrunt, Pipelines, git etc.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: azuresysadmin@pm.me
- âš¡ Fun fact: I managed to get 157WPM on https://monkeytype.com and I play bass in two bands.
- Interests: Open Source in general, zsh modifications, Vim, lifting weights and music.
